Over the last years I transitioned into a more lead position within Machine Learning, spending more time supervising, building strategic partnerships and setting the long term direction for the area. I enjoy coming up with great solutions with people that are often better at pure programming and math but often benefit from guidance in order to make all 
components come together at the right time and scale.
