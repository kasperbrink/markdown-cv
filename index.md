Over the last few years, I have transitioned into a more lead position within Machine Learning. I spend more time supervising, building strategic partnerships, and setting the long-term direction for the area, while still developing and maintaining ML solutions. I have successfully created a variety of ML products with individuals who are often extemely at programming and math, but benefit from guidance in order to make all components come together at the right time and scale. Additionally, I have had to terminate projects with a poor likelihood of success and have done so in a way that kept the involved parties engaged and motivated for other projects. This position seems to be a oppurtinity to bring ML into a new domain which I find highly motivating.
